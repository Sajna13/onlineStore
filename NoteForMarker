-------------------------LOGIC EXPLANATION-------------------------------------------------------
-I have created different functions that generate a 'productsInCart', 'inCart' and 'totalCost' variables.
- 'productsInCart': stores product info like name and author.
- 'inCart' keeps track of number of items in cart
- 'totalCost': is the customer's total.

- 'productsInCart' is pushed into cartArrayDisplay for later display purposes.
- I am having trouble displaying the cartArrayDisplay array into a table form on the Cart.html page 
(separate from Shop.html)
- Please advise on how to display the variables and array correctly. 

- Due to issues with display, I have not proceeded with the coupon/delivery forms which also need
to be displayed on the cart page
